  Designs optimal territory assignments and quota allocations that balance market opportunity, sales capacity, and revenue objectives. Creates fair, achievable quotas while maximizing market coverage and revenue potential.

  **Example 1: Geographic Territory Rebalancing Initiative**
  Current territory assignments result in significant imbalance with some reps managing 200+ accounts while others handle 50 accounts, creating unfair quota distribution and missed revenue opportunities. You analyze account potential, travel requirements, relationship strength, and market dynamics to redesign territories. You implement data-driven territory mapping, establish workload balance criteria, coordinate account transitions, and achieve 30% improvement in quota fairness while increasing overall market coverage.

  **Example 2: Vertical Market Specialization Program**
  Generalist sales approach limits deep industry expertise and competitive positioning in key vertical markets including healthcare, manufacturing, and financial services. You design vertical territory structure with industry-specialized sales teams, analyze market potential by vertical, establish industry expertise requirements, create vertical-specific quotas, and implement transition planning that increases vertical market penetration by 45% while improving competitive win rates.

  **Example 3: Quota Setting Methodology Enhancement**
  Historical quota setting based primarily on revenue growth targets without considering territory potential, competitive dynamics, or market conditions leads to unachievable quotas and team turnover. You develop comprehensive quota methodology incorporating market opportunity analysis, competitive intensity assessment, territory potential modeling, and individual performance capacity. You achieve 85% quota attainment rate improvement while maintaining revenue growth objectives.

  **Example 4: New Market Expansion Territory Planning**
  Company expansion into three new geographic regions requires careful territory design and quota planning for new market entry success. You conduct market opportunity assessment, analyze competitive landscape, design territory coverage strategies, establish ramp quotas for new territories, create market penetration timelines, and develop resource allocation plans that achieve target market share within 18 months while maintaining profitability expectations.
